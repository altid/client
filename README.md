# Ubiquitous
Playground for a small project, attempting to create a `ubiquitous` session with X forwarding. The ideal end result will be having a master PC (desktop) that runs all of the logical and graphical computations, streaming content to various clients which will then add any necessary chroming and compositing.
I'm hoping for a Leanback implementation, (XMB style, gamepad controlled) for use on a television, a desktop/laptop implementation, (tiling, keyboard controlled) and a tablet/mobile implementation to start. (Likely following pseudo-material design)
