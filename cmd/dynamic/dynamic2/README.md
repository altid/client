# Dynamic Client for Altid

This is a compile-time pluggable client for connecting to Altid services. 

## Backends

Initial support will be written for ncurses, and GTK+ drawing libraries; 9p communiciation, and vi-like input. In the future, more drawing libraries will be added, with their own configurability; as well as ssh as a transport mechanism, and readline support.
